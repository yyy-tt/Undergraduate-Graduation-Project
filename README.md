  The permanent magnet positioning method provideexcellent positioning solutions in medical applications such as capsule endoscopic robot positioning and cancer cell positioning due to its non-contact, low-cost, and real-time characteristics. The traditional positioning optimization algorithm has good results when applied to single magnets. But due to the uncertainty of the position and orientation of dual 
 magnets, the positioning effect of traditional methods cannot meet expectations. To improve the positioning accuracy of dual or multiple magnets and solve the problem of time-consuming database construction caused by the need for large amounts of data in deep learning methods, this paper proposes a dual magnetic positioning method that integrates residual neural networks (ResNet) and LM (Levenberg-Marquardt) algorithm, and uses a magnetic dipole model to generate a dataset to reduce the large amount of time required for manual data collection. The experimental results show that within the height range of 35-90mm, the positioning accuracy of our method can reach (2.68 ± 0.85) mm and (1.05°± 0.51°) for each magnet. This paper improves the accuracy and stability of the dual magnetic positioning method while ensuring easy access and lightweight of the database.
